# Key Facial Point Detection 
_A Deep learning and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) project_

This project has three main components: a basic analysis/EDA, a hypothesis test, and a customer segmentation, all focused on data from [(via Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection).  

"Facial keypoint detection is a challenging problem in the field of computer vision. It serves as the basis for Emotional AI. The keypoint detection is done by predicting the coordinates of certain facial features." In this paper, facial keypoint detection is predicted using convolutional neural networks.

The Data set consists of x and y coordinates of 15 facial key points. Input images are gray scale with 96x96 pixels. RESNET (Residual Network) will be used as  it skip connection feature which provides training of 152 layers without vanishing gradient issues. It works by joining Identity mapping on top of CNN. 

# Instacart Analysis
